Hi I'm some dude that blogs on the internet about infosec.  This is primarily a learning blog, which means it's how I solved an issue, not how to solve the issue.  Let me know if there's anything to update.

### Some More Information

Opinions are my own and not that of my employer. :)

Also check out the [README](https://its-youmu.github.io/readme/) for additional information regarding disclaimer/licensing.

### Contact me

Depending on the request/question/comment, I'm easiest to reach either via opening an issue or [via twitter](https://twitter.com/youmusec).
